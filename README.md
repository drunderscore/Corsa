# Corsa
A modern C++ wrapper for the Steamworks SDK

## Provide your own Steamworks SDK
You **must** provide your own Steamworks SDK from here: https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk

Either put the `sdk` folder into the Corsa root directory, or set the `STEAMWORKS_SDK` CMake
variable to point to an `sdk` folder.
